        To start using the app, enter a group-name of your choice in the top-left corner and press 'Enter'. Then tell your friends
        to enter the same group-name as you, and you will be able to see each other. Note that each player updates every
        time they enter a new zone.

    <h3 class="mat-h3">Donations</h3>
    <p class="mat-body-1">
        This thing got more popular than we thought it would, and are looking at ways to optimize the hosting-plan. Currently we're estimating it to be 280$ monthly and growing as more users join. 
        Supporting/donating is of course something we do not expect of you! We love that you're using our app no matter what and this will never be a requirement. However, if you feel like supporting this, here's a patreon-link:<br/>
